// The http.ResponseWriter is an interface, and the existing types implementing this interface are pointers.
// That means there's no need to use a pointer to this interface, as it's already "backed" by a pointer.
// http.Request is not an interface, it's just a struct.
// It is not supposed to be mutable, but it is large so copying it will reduce performance.
// So it is passed in as a pointer.
